# How to contribute

## Generated code

Most code in this package is generated by the
[async-aws code generator](https://packagist.org/packages/async-aws/code-generator).

Changes should be done in the manifest file and code should be regenerated
instead of changing it directly, as manual changes will be lost when the code
is regenerated. The CI will enforce that rule.
To regenerate the code, run:

```bash
./generate --all
```

As Amazon Incentives does not provide an API description for SDKs in the format
used for AWS SDKs, we are maintaining it ourselves in the
[`manifest`](../manifest/) folder. This manifest is partial. It only covers the
endpoints supported by the SDK.
